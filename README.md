2) Make **sure** you have the following assets in your MetaMask wallet **FOR THE ACCOUNT ADDRESS WITH WHICH YOU ARE USING THE BOT**
    - **BNB** (this is needed for gas)
    - **WBNB** (this is used to purchase the desired token)

# Test

1) IF you want to TEST the bot using BNB / BUSD, then ADD the BUSD custom token to your MetaMask (0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56)

2) Run the bot using the to_Purchase value of the BUSD token contract. This works because liquidity is frequently added to this pool.
